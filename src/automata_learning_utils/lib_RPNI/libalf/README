libalf is a C++ library that implements several learning algorithms for finite
automata.


DEPENCENCIES:


libalf is a stand-alone C++ library, no external libraries except the C++
standard library and standard template library (STL) are required. Also, MiniSat
v1.14 is fully integrated into libalf, as it is required for the bierman
learning algorithm. there are no further dependencies.

however, the following libraries may be of help when developing applications and
are partially required for some of the testcases:

1) libAMoRE-1.0 / libAMoRE++ : C/C++ automata library for working with finite
automata. (both AMoRE-1.0 with some patches and the C++ interface currently
reside in the subversion repository of libalf. the C++ interface has been
written during development of libalf, but we're currently working on integrating
it into the original libAMoRE (upstream).)

2) liblangen (LANguageGENerator) is a library for generating (regular) languages
in the form of automata or regular expressions. it came to existence during the
development of libalf and thus has the same interfaces for automata. it is
useful e.g. for generating random automata or regex with specific constraints,
so algorithms can automatically massively be tested.
